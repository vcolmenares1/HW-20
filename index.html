    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>Project Description: Our goal was to test and analyze the function of elements, improve, and reconstruct the Cat
        Network's current website design while evaluating website heuristics and usability to ensure ease of use and
        display information efficiently.

        Team Members: Alejandra Penas, Eleana Gomez, Jasmine Pierce, Valentina Colmenares

        Tools Used: Figma, FigJam, Google Drive, Google Slides, Google Docs.
        Project Overview

        The Problem:The current website for the non-profit organization, The Cat Network, has issues with user clarity
        on how to find information about volunteer opportunities, how to adopt available cats and how to best educate
        the public on the social issues that they aim to correct.

        The Solution: A reorganization and redesign of the main navigation, as well as providing more visual aids to the
        user for how to navigate the website in order to complete their tasks and be better informed of the number of
        ways in which the user can provide support to the nonprofit organization.
    </p>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>Our research began with a heuristic evaluation of the home page, about page and volunteer page. We found that the
        website lacked depth, using white space inappropriately. The website's main functions were unclear, and users
        often could not find the information they were looking for, or had to go through multiple screens to complete a
        main task.
        The team developed interview questions after defining a persona, placing ourselves in the user's shoes. The
        interview began with introductory questions about the interviewee's demographics, and then dove into the main
        lines of questioning. Our topics sought to define the interviewee's level of experience participating in
        community service programs, what drives users to support nonprofits, affinity towards caring for animals, and
        their opinions on education about community issues.

        After conducting our interviews we found that most users have some level of experience in volunteering, most
        notably for food banks. All interviewees were pet owners, having either a dog, cat or both. All interviewees
        identified as animal lovers, and expressed willingness to aid local animals in need.

        Next, the team looked at three websites of similar nature, Stray Paws Safe Haven, Alley Cat Allies, and the
        Feral Cat Program of Georgia. We analyzed the sites to identify must-have features for other animal non-profit
        organizations. We decided to prioritize that users are able to easily identify a donate button, include current
        events, and easily learn about ways to get involved or support the organization as the most important features
        to include in our redesign.

    <h2>Sketches</h2>
    <p>Sketches and Wireframes
        We began the design process with a sketch of the Home Page. We placed “About Us,” “How to Help,” “Community,”
        and “Donate” on the main navigation, as our research showed that these were most often used by people using
        animal nonprofit websites.</p>
