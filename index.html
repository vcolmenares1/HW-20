        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>Project Description: Our goal was to test and analyze the function of elements, improve, and reconstruct the
            Cat
            Network's current website design while evaluating website heuristics and usability to ensure ease of use and
            display information efficiently.

            Tools Used: Figma, FigJam, Google Drive, Google Slides, Google Docs.
            Project Overview

            The Problem:The current website for the non-profit organization, The Cat Network, has issues with user
            clarity
            on how to find information about volunteer opportunities, how to adopt available cats and how to best
            educate
            the public on the social issues that they aim to correct.

            The Solution: A reorganization and redesign of the main navigation, as well as providing more visual aids to
            the
            user for how to navigate the website in order to complete their tasks and be better informed of the number
            of
            ways in which the user can provide support to the nonprofit organization.
        </p>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Our research began with a heuristic evaluation of the home page, about page and volunteer page. We found that
            the
            website lacked depth, using white space inappropriately. The website's main functions were unclear, and
            users
            often could not find the information they were looking for, or had to go through multiple screens to
            complete a
            main task.
            The team developed interview questions after defining a persona, placing ourselves in the user's shoes. The
            interview began with introductory questions about the interviewee's demographics, and then dove into the
            main
            lines of questioning. Our topics sought to define the interviewee's level of experience participating in
            community service programs, what drives users to support nonprofits, affinity towards caring for animals,
            and
            their opinions on education about community issues.

            After conducting our interviews we found that most users have some level of experience in volunteering, most
            notably for food banks. All interviewees were pet owners, having either a dog, cat or both. All interviewees
            identified as animal lovers, and expressed willingness to aid local animals in need.

            Next, the team looked at three websites of similar nature, Stray Paws Safe Haven, Alley Cat Allies, and the
            Feral Cat Program of Georgia. We analyzed the sites to identify must-have features for other animal
            non-profit
            organizations. We decided to prioritize that users are able to easily identify a donate button, include
            current
            events, and easily learn about ways to get involved or support the organization as the most important
            features
            to include in our redesign.

        <p>
            We began the design process with a sketch of the Home Page. We placed “About Us,” “How to Help,”
            “Community,”
            and “Donate” on the main navigation, as our research showed that these were most often used by people using
            animal nonprofit websites.</p>
        <img class="projectImages" src="img/The Cat Network Sketches-2.png">
        <p>We then went onto designing the About Us Page, including a mission statement, some background information
            about the organization, list of partners for reputability, and a fillable contact form at the bottom of the
            page.
        </p>
        <img class="projectImages" src="img/The Cat Network Sketches-3.png">
        <p>We then went onto our How to Help Page, which included the most important information for the function of our
            non profit. This page informs users of volunteer opportunities with eye catching images and includes a
            fillable volunteer form.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>After successfully redesigning the Cat Network's website, there are several future steps to consider in order
            to maintain and enhance its effectiveness:

            Regular Maintenance: Continue to maintain and update the website to keep it running smoothly. This includes
            fixing any bugs or technical issues that may arise, updating content, and ensuring compatibility with new
            web technologies.

            Content Updates: Keep the website's content fresh and relevant. Regularly update information about the
            organization's programs, events, and success stories. Highlight new initiatives and achievements.

            Monitoring and Analytics: Implement website analytics tools to track user behavior and engagement. Analyze
            data to understand how visitors interact with the site, which pages are most popular, and where users might
            encounter difficulties. Use this information to make data-driven decisions for further improvements.

            User Feedback: Encourage and collect user feedback through surveys, contact forms, or social media. Pay
            close attention to user comments and suggestions, and use this feedback to make continuous improvements to
            the website.

            Mobile Optimization: Ensure that the website is mobile-friendly and responsive. With an increasing number of
            users accessing websites via mobile devices, it's crucial to provide a seamless experience on all screen
            sizes.

            Accessibility: Ensure the website complies with accessibility standards to make it inclusive and accessible
            to all users, including those with disabilities.

            Social Media Integration: Promote the website and its content through social media channels. Encourage
            sharing and engagement to reach a wider audience and increase support for the nonprofit's cause.

            Continuous Improvement: Maintain a culture of continuous improvement by regularly reviewing the website's
            performance, seeking user feedback, and adapting to changing technology trends and user needs.

            By following these steps, we can ensure that the Cat Network's website remains an effective tool for raising
            awareness, engaging supporters, and furthering the organization's mission.
